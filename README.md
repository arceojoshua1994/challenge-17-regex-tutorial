## Regex Tutorial: Matching an Email Address

In the vast expanse of the internet, it's essential to ensure the correctness of an email address format. In this tutorial, we will delve into the regular expression that validates email addresses. By the end, you'll have a clear understanding of each component that makes up this regex and its role in the validation process.

## Summary

We will explore the regex:

/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

This regex pattern is designed to match valid email addresses. It ensures the email starts with a series of characters, has an @ symbol, follows with a domain name, and ends with a domain extension.

## Anchors
Anchors are used to ensure the match is positioned in a particular place:

"^": Asserts start of a line
"$": Asserts end of a line

In our regex, these anchors ensure the entire string is examined from start to finish, making certain that our pattern matches the whole email address.

## Quantifiers
Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences:

+: Matches one or more of the preceding element.
In our pattern, + ensures that:

There's one or more of the characters in the user name portion.
There's one or more characters in the domain name.


## Grouping Constructs
Parentheses () are used for grouping:

([a-z0-9_\.-]+): This group matches the user name of the email. It allows lowercase alphabets, numbers, underscore, dot, and hyphen.
([\da-z\.-]+): This group matches the domain name, allowing numbers, lowercase alphabets, dot, and hyphen.
([a-z\.]{2,6}): This group matches the domain extension, permitting 2 to 6 lowercase alphabets or dots.
Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions [] are used to define a character class where you want to match any single character out of the characters enclosed:

[a-z0-9_\.-]: Matches any lowercase letter, number, underscore, dot, or hyphen.
[\da-z\.-]: Matches any digit or lowercase letter, dot, or hyphen.
Character Classes
Character classes represent a set of characters:

\d: Matches any digit (0-9).
In our pattern, \d within the domain name bracket expression ensures that the domain can have numbers.
